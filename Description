NBA Salaries is a linear regression analysis and modeling on NBA player's salaries based on their stats.
-step 1:
I imported the datas that I downloaded from kaggle into python, cleaned and sorted them and removed the duplicates and players with missing data.
then I extracted an excel file from python and named it "DF.xlsx"
-step 2:
Then I imported the extracted excel file into R-Studio and began the linear regression modeling. 
using anova and stepwise method i found out that only PPG,TOPG,RPG and APG coefficients are significant.
using the graphical methods and hypothesis test, the data doesn't meet the OLS Assumptions 3 and 5 (homoscedasticity and normality of errors)
