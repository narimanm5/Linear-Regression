"NBA Salaries is an in-depth data analysis project focused on using linear regression to model NBA player salaries based on their performance statistics. The project began with the importation of data from Kaggle, followed by cleaning, sorting, and eliminating duplicates and incomplete player information in Python. Subsequently, an Excel file named 'DF.xlsx' was extracted from the processed data.

The analysis then transitioned to R-Studio, where a detailed linear regression modeling process was initiated. Utilizing ANOVA and a stepwise method, it was discovered that only PPG, TOPG, RPG, and APG coefficients held significant correlations with player salaries. However, further examination using graphical methods and hypothesis testing revealed that the data did not adhere to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Assumptions 3 and 5, pertaining to homoscedasticity and normality of errors respectively."
